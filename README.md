El-Corona is one of the assignment question

Aim: Simulate COVID-19. 
The main purpose is actually to help building an algorithm to trace back the possible infected person by using the activity log.

This is just a small simulation but we are planning to implement it using big data to trace the possible infected person in current situation in 2020.

For this simulation, for a better viewing of the activity log, there is a folder containing all the activity log of each of the human in our simulation city and for each of the places as well. The committed project is using HashMap to retrieve the log and not from text file. Text file is just for clearer understanding of how we store the activity log.
